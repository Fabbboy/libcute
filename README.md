 - [ ] Slab Allocator
 - [ ] Arena Allocator 

macro-features:
 - [X] IF_NULL
 - [X] IF_NOT_NULL
 - [X] DIE 
 - [X] UNUSED

 - [ ] TODO(msg) (with line and file)

object-features:
 - [X] generic optional
 - [X] generic result

## Allocators
All methods or datastructures that need an allocator should accept the generic allocator interface in a zig style 
 
## Coding standards
Code must be written and formatted in a `clang-format`-friendly way.

All methods and structs that do not represent standard library types (e.g. `Int_Optional`) must be prefixed with `cu_`. This prefix is followed by the category (e.g. `Allocator`) and finally the actual type or function name.

Example:
 - `PageAllocator` ‚Üí `cu_Allocator_PageAllocator`

The same naming convention applies to functions.

Filenames must be lowercase. If the filename contains multiple words, use underscores (`_`) to separate them.

All headers must be included in the `cute.h` umbrella header.

Utility types and methods that do not belong to any specific subsystem can be placed in the root directory.

Files that can be implemented in C should **not** use header-based implementations (i.e., avoid `static inline` unless necessary or otherways useless).

If additional types are required for implementation or if you come up with something useful, add it to the list above.

## Commit Style

This project does **not** enforce conventional commits, but commits should follow a minimal style that helps generate meaningful changelogs.

### üß± Format Guidelines

- Start with the general area or subsystem being modified (e.g., `allocator`, `macro`, `vector`)
- Be short but descriptive
- Use lowercase only for prefixes
- Avoid "Update", "Changes", or generic nonsense

#### ‚úÖ Good examples
```
allocator: implement aligned page allocator
macro: add CU_ARRAY_LEN
slice: refactor to support zero-length spans
hashmap: stub file with header structure
simd: add platform dispatch detection
```

#### ‚ùå Bad examples
```
update stuff
misc fixes
more work
final version
```

This style is compatible with the changelog generator (`git-cliff.toml`) and ensures readable release notes.
