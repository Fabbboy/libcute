## Coding standards
Code must be written and formatted in a `clang-format`-friendly way.

All methods and structs that do not represent standard library types (e.g. `Int_Optional`) must be prefixed with `cu_`. This prefix is followed by the category (e.g. `Allocator`) and finally the actual type or function name.

Example:
- `PageAllocator` â†’ `cu_Allocator_PageAllocator`

The same naming convention applies to functions.

Filenames must be lowercase. If the filename contains multiple words, use underscores (`_`) to separate them.

All headers must be included in the `cute.h` umbrella header.

Utility types and methods that do not belong to any specific subsystem can be placed in the root directory.

Files that can be implemented in C should **not** use header-based implementations (i.e., avoid `static inline` unless necessary).

If additional types are required for implementation or if you come up with something useful, add it to the list above.
